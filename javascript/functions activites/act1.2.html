    <p>Create an object car with properties make, model, and year. Add a method getCarAge that calculates the car's age based on the current year and logs "This car is [age] years old". Assume the current year is 2024 and call the method to display the car's age.</p>

    <script>
       let car = {
    make: "Toyota",
    model: "Camry",
    year: 2018,
    getCarAge: function() {
        let currentYear = 2024;
        let age = currentYear-this.year;
        console.log(`This car is ${age} years old.`);
    }
};


// Call the method to display the car's age
car.getCarAge();
    </script>
