               <span class="text">"The tree which</span>  moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing which stands in
                the way.
                Some see nature all ridicule and deformity, and by these I shall not regulate my propositions. And some
                see no nature at all.
                But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself."

                <span class="text">Mountains</span> are also a powerful metaphor for successfully achieving a goal in life or business through
                hard work and perseverance.
                Like a mountain, life is full of ups and downs and challenges along the way. And just like climbing to
                the top of an actual mountain,
                the only way to tackle a personal problem giving you pause or achieving the next level in your career is
                to start by placing one foot in
                front of the other. As Mother Abbess famously encouraged Maria in The Sound of Music, take every step
                you can, climb each next hill, until
                you reach your dream!
